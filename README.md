🚨 Spoiler Alert: **NO.** 🚨

## What's This?
Welcome to **DidWeReachAGI.com**, a highly complex, deeply philosophical website that answers one of the most burning questions of our time:

**"Did we reach AGI?"**

And the answer (so far) is... well... **NO.**

## Features ✨
- **Massive NO** in the center of the screen.
- Responsiveness that makes sure the NO looks perfect on any device.
- A footer that says it all: "Powered by [aiagent.observer](https://aiagent.observer)" because we believe in giving credit where it's due.
- Zero fluff. Just the facts.

## Why? 🤔
Why not? Sometimes the most profound answers are the simplest. Plus, I had a domain, and it seemed like the right thing to do. 

## Contributing 👩‍💻👨‍💻
Feel free to contribute by:
- **Improving the NO**: Maybe a more vibrant shade of red? Or perhaps a 3D animated NO? I'm open to ideas!
- **Changing the answer**: If we reach AGI, let’s celebrate! PRs welcome for changing the NO to... well, we’ll deal with that when the time comes. 😅
- **Adding some personality**: This site has potential to be funnier, right? Help me out!
